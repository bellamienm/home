		<p>Servings: 6 patties
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<!-- Unorganised listed ingredients for recipe --> 
		<ul>
			<li>Ground chuck – We prefer an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for the juiciest burgers.</li>
			<li>Crushed crackers or Panko bread crumbs – The best binders for juicy hamburgers. (Could be gluten-free!)</li>
			<li>Worcestershire sauce – Adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor.</li>
			<li>Egg – To bind all of the ingredients together without drying.</li>
			<li>Milk – The enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef.</li>
			<li>Seasonings: Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion powder, Pepper, or other spices of choice(dried herbs recommended)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<h3>Step 1: </h3>
		<p>Set out a large mixing bowl and add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg, 
		Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices. Use your hands to thoroughly combine until 
		the mixture is very smooth.</p>
		<h3>Step 2: </h3>
		<p>Press the meat down in the bowl, into an even disk. Use a knife to cut and 
		divide the hamburger patty mixture into 6 – 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties, or 12 thin griddle patties.</p>
		<h3>Step 3: </h3>
		<p>Set out a baking sheet, lined with wax paper or foil, to hold the patties. 
		One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness. 
		Tip! You typically want hamburger patties to be slightly larger than the buns they&rsquo;ll be 
		served on since they’ll shrink a bit in the cooking process.</p>
		<h3>Step 4: </h3>
		<p>Place the formed patties on the baking sheet. With thick patties, press 
		a dent in the center of each patty, so they don’t puff up while cooking. You can stack 
		the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed.</p>
		<h3>Step 5: </h3>
		<p>Preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degrees F. </p>
		<p>For thick patties: Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger. </p>
		<p>For thin patties: Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side.</p>
		<h3>Step 6: </h3>
		<p>Stack the hot patties on hamburger buns, and dress up with your favorite hamburger toppings and condiments.</p>
