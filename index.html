		<!-- Introductory paragraph. -->
		<p>Food around the world has a rich history. The evolution of the human diet has
		changed vastly over the years. The first humans hunted, fought, and based their 
		whole existence on getting food for their survival. Certain regions grew plants that were 
		indigenous to them and was home to animals that were found nowhere else. As civilization 
		grew and humans evolved, we started cooking and adding flavor to our meals. Various meat 
		and vegetables were added to our diets and spices were discovered for flavor. Our meals have 
		now become a delicacy and all types of regions have come up with recipes that excite
		our taste buds. Our perception of food has greatly changed from consumption for survival 
		to a fun fest for our tastebuds.</p>
		<!-- All of the famous meals listed below discriptively. -->
		<h2 id="Hamburgers">Hamburgers</h2>
		<img src="hamburgers.jpeg" width="500" alt="A picture of a double cheese hamburger">
		<p>There is no doubt that hamburgers are loved and enjoyed all over the world, but according 
		to www.therichest.com, the USA consumes the most fast food in the world with burgers taking up 
		more than <a href="https://www.therichest.com/location/countries-that-consume-the-most-fast-food-or-junk-food/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20eats%20the,food%20expenditure%20in%20the%20country."
		>50 percent</a> of total fast food expenditure in the country. They have become a 
		favorite go-to meal as they are cheap and easy to eat.</p>
		<p>Hamburgers are preferable because the meat is ground up and served in a bun, they invite 
		toppings which add flavor. Because burgers come with an array of sides, you can <a href="hamburger.html">build 
		yours</a> to your taste. Fast food chains like Mcdonald&rsquo;s, Burger King, and Subway bring 
		in the most revenue for burger sales in America.</p>
		<h2 id="Nachos">Nachos</h2>
		<img src="nachos.jpeg" width="500" alt="picture of nachos with various toppings on wooden picnic table.">
		<p>The common dish known today as nachos originated in Northern Mexico. The first plate 
		of nachos was made for a group of military officers&rsquo; wives in 1943 in Piedras Negras. They 
		had stopped for dinner at The Old Victory Club after a day of shopping where a chef named 
		Anaya put the dish together using leftover ingredients. The plate consisted of
		plate consisted of tortilla chips, tortilla chips, cheese, and jalapeño peppers.</p>
		<p><a href="nachos-recipe.html">Nachos</a> are loved for their perfect mix of crunchiness and flavorful cheesy sauces. 
		It has versatile topping options which can suit the cravings of anyone&rsquo;s palate. Nachos 
		are a type of food that can be mixed up for any occasion because you can change up the 
		toppings to meet the event. A yearly festival called 
		<a href="https://www.holidayscalendar.com/event/international-day-of-the-nacho/">The 
		International Nacho Festival</a> is held in Piedras Negras to celebrate this amazing dish.</p>
		<h2 id="Tacos">Tacos</h2>
		<img src="tacos.jpeg" width="500" alt="two mango catfish tacos">
		<p><a href="tacos.html">Tacos</a> are the national dish of Mexico. A taco is anything eaten on a soft tortilla, 
		and there is an infinite variety of them. The word taco dates back to the Mexican 
		silver mines of the 18th century, when it referred to gunpowder that was 
		wrapped in a piece of paper and inserted into rocks. Today, the word is widely known 
		to signify the leading street food and fast food item in Mexico – thin, flat griddle-baked 
		tortillas topped with numerous fillings, folded and eaten without any utensils.</p>
		<p>Tacos are thought to come from Mexico long before the Spanish arrived. Ancient Mexicans 
		used freshly made, soft, flat corn tortillas and gave them with fillings like fish and cooked 
		organs. It was a staple meal that provided vital nutrients and energy to those who consumed it.
		These tacos didn’t contain the cheese, lettuce, sour cream, and tomato that we associate with 
		the meal today. In fact, the taco as we know it is less than 100 years old.</p>
		<h2 id="Barbecue">Barbecue</h2>
		<img src="barbeque.jpeg" width="500" alt="various meat and sausages grilling on a barbecue">
		<p>Barbecuing is aloved by Americans because they are not limited to just grilling steak and pork 
		alone. Sausages, seafood, chicken and vegetables are barbecued too, many <a href="barbeque-ribs.html">methods</a> 
		are practiced to give food that smoky barbecue flavour we love. The most famous barbecuing 
		technique enjoyed by Americans is to <a href="https://www.ricardocuisine.com/en/articles/techniques/7-barbecue-cooking-methods#Cooking%20Technique"
		>indirectly</a> grill their meat so it does not cook on an open fire. The barbecue is lit so the 
		fire burns on one side of the grill and food cooks on the unlit side, or the coals are banked on 
		both sides of the grill and the food cooks in the middle.</p>
		<p> The American BBQ tradition owes its origins to the fusion of many cultural food 
		traditions, including African and Caribbean.At its earliest origins, barbecue involved 
		slow-cooking meat over sticks and saplings, a common activity among indigenous Americans 
		and Caribbeans. Today barbecuing has become a form of enjoyment as meat, usually pork, is 
		put over a charcoal grill and covered in spices and herbs. Americans love cooking outdoors
		because it improves the meat&rsquo;s flavor, for personal enjoyment and for entertaining family and friends.</p>
		<h2 id="Mac&Cheese">Mac and Cheese</h2>
		<img src="mac&cheese.png" width="500" alt="baked mac and cheese in caserole pan">
		<p>Mac and cheese - formerly known as macaroni and cheese - is a famous dish in America 
		for its cheesy goodness and comes in many delicious 
		<a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/g2962/50-most-delish-mac-cheese/?slide=3"> 
		variations</a>. The main ingredients are macaroni, cheese, and butter. It is prepared by 
		cooking pasta and a cheesy white sauce in separate pans, then combining it to bake in an 
		oven with even more cheese.</p>
		<p>The US president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> 
		encountered mac and cheese in Paris, the dish soon became popularized with the help of his 
		slave who was a French chef. Mac and cheese is loved by Americans for how quick and easy is 
		it to prepare, making it a go-to dish for anyone who wants a filling meal but doesn&rsquo;t 
		have the best culinary skills.</p>
		<!-- Backstory on the oldest meals we still eat today. -->
		<h2> The oldest meals we still eat today:</h2>
		<p>For thousands of years we were hunters and gatherers. We ate raw meat and chewed 
		on tree bark. We have now evolved from raw meat eaters to stew makers, farmers and 
		finally where we are today. We eat well-processed foods that have dramatically less 
		bacteria before they land on our dinner plates. Advancement in technology and more of food 
		structured systems for manufacturing food has allowed for food to take an entirely new form.</p>
		<h3> Stew </h3>		
		<img src="stew.jpeg" width="500" alt="Bowl of stew besides chopping board with chopped vegetable ingredients.">
		<p> It is one of the most popular delicacies loved by meat lovers, for many countries, 
		it is a popular comfort food. Putting a date on the world&rsquo;s first bowl of stew is 
		probably impossible. Anthropologists haven&rsquo;t been able to determine for certain when 
		man was first able to control fire, or when cooking itself was invented. Through
		much of human history, stews were much simpler, requiring nothing more than 
		adding a chunk of meat or other foods to boiling water to make a nourishing broth. 
		Stews are believed to have been prepared in waterproof and heatproof containers found 
		in 20,000-year-old caves in China by Harvard University archeologists, <a href=
		"https://www.archaeology.org/news/533-130208-cooking-soup-hunters" >Ofer Bar-Yosef</a>. 
		Stews could also have been cooked by Neanderthals, by dropping heated rocks into a 
		pit lined with animal skin, which could heat water and other ingredients.</p>
		<h3> Pancakes </h3>
		<img src="pancakes.jpeg" width="500" alt="plate of pancakes with frozen rasberries">
		<p> Pancakes are a staple breakfast in many American households, 
		they have been around for 30,000 years (since the stone age). Researchers 
		have even found wheat-based pancakes in the stomach remains of the mummified 5,000 year 
		old body of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ötzi" > Ötzi The Iceman</a>. 
		Greeks and Romans made this breakfast treat using wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and 
		curdled milk, which is a little different from the pancakes we know today. As time passed, 
		people started flavoring their pancakes using rose water, spices, sherry, and apples. 
		However, while the first reference to pancakes came from ancient Greece, variations 
		of pancakes existed in most countries around the world for centuries in some form as 
		a breakfast food or treat similar to, but sweeter than, bread. </p>
		<h3> Bread </h3>		
		<img src="bread.jpeg" width="500" alt="variety of wheat bread"> 
		<p>According to history, the earliest bread was made in or around 8000 BC in the 
		Middle East, specifically Egypt. The quern was the first known grinding tool. Grain 
		was crushed and the bakers produced what we now commonly recognize in its closest 
		form as chapatis (India) or tortillas (Mexico). It is thought that their brewing 
		expertise combined with the warm climate produced the world&rsquo;s <a href = "http://lyonbakery.com/the-origin-of-bread/" > 
		first sourdough </a>. Apparently, the use of fermentation to make bread rise was discovered 
		by accident, when someone left some dough in the sun and it rose. Since then, bread 
		achieved distinction as a staple food product in all parts of the world. In the following 
		centuries, countries developed their versions of bread. Some leavened, others not.</p>
