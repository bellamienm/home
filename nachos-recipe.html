		<!-- Introductory sentence. -->
		<p>We all admit that nachos are a great treat to the palate but a soggy plate of nachos 
		can quickly ruin it for us. This recipe will help you avoid just that and will allow you to 
		enjoy a delicious plate of nachos for any occasion.</p>
		<p>This recipe allows you to have a variety of protein as well as topping options and best 
		of all it is quick and easy to prepare. The versatility of a nacho dish can be changed 
		to match anyone&rsquo;s appetite and as for this recipe, I will be using my favorite beef and bean topping.</p>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<h3>Step 1: Preheat oven to 350 &deg;F</h3>
		<h3>Step 2: Make the taco spice blend</h3>
		<p>combine all of the spices in a small bowl</p>
		<h3>Step 3: Make the beef and bean topping</h3>
		<p>Heat the vegetable oil on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add the 
		ground beef to the pan and season it with all of the taco spice blend. As the meat 
		cooks, use a spoon to break the meat up into crumbles.</p>
		<p>Cook for about 8 minutes until the meat has browned and drain the fat using a colander.</p>
		<p>Return the meat to the pan and add the refried beans and the water. Heat the mixture 
		until the beans are smooth and warmed through. Reduce the heat to low and keep the 
		beef-bean mixture warm while you prepare the chips.</p>
		<h3>Step 4: Toast the chips</h3>
		<p>Toasting the chips help us to avoid soggy nachos. On a 13x18-inch oven-safe 
		platter or sheet pan, arrange the tortilla chips in a single layer, overlapping 
		them slightly. Toast the chips in the preheated oven for 5 minutes, or just until 
		you begin to smell their aroma.</p>
		<h3>Step 5: Assemble and bake the nachos</h3>
		<p>Carefully remove the pan from the oven and top with one-half of the shredded cheese. 
		Allow the heat from the chips to melt the cheese slightly before topping the chips 
		with the beef and bean mixture.</p>
		<p>Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the beef and return the pan to the oven for 5 
		minutes, or until the cheese has fully melted.</p>
		<h3>Step 5: Top and serve</h3>
		<p>Top the nachos with the pico de gallo, chopped cilantro, jalape&ntilde;o slices, or any 
		of your preferred toppings. Serve hot.</p>
